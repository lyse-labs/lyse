# Reliability — how Lyse measures itself

> The Health Score is the central output of Lyse. If it is wrong, the whole product is wrong. This page explains how Lyse measures precision, how it measures recall, and what numbers you can trust.

## Why a reliability system

Every percentage Lyse cites is reproducible from a public dataset on your machine. No vibes, no hidden corpora, no silent formula changes.

## The 4 pillars

### Pillar 1 — Precision via opt-in user feedback

`lyse audit --interactive` walks each finding and asks `valid? (y/n/?/s/q)`. Your verdict is HMAC-bucketed (`repo_bucket = HMAC(rotating_salt, repo_remote_url)`, 16 hex chars), IP-stripped at Cloudflare Worker ingress, and aggregated into a Bayesian Beta(8, 2) prior — a new sub-axis starts at ~0.80 confidence on day one.

**Movement is weight-sensitive.** ~5 negative *signed* votes drop the posterior under 0.55; ~30 drop it under 0.30. Unsigned votes are weighted 10× lower (anti-spam), so ~50 unsigned drop the posterior 25 pp. Per-IP rate-limit (30 reqs/min) bounds the attack rate.

The full event payload is `{ ruleId, subAxisId, repoBucket, verdict, signed }` — no file path, line, message, or snippet. The whole loop is opt-in: gated on `~/.lyse/consent.json` (`accepted: true`), written by the first-run consent prompt or `lyse telemetry on`. Without consent, Lyse is fully local.

### Pillar 2 — Recall via the antivirus harness

Precision tells you whether a finding is real. Recall tells you whether you caught every finding that exists. Lyse measures recall against three sources:

- **Combinatorial generator** — ~30-50 format × context fixtures per rule across 4 contexts (CSS file, JSX inline style, styled-components, Tailwind arbitrary).
- **9 reference OSS design systems** — Cal.com, Twenty, Plane, Documenso, Cap, Formbricks, Mantine, Radix UI, shadcn/ui — mined for real-world violations.
- **Frozen gold set** — ~8k Claude-seeded provisional labels (see "Gold-set composition" below); community re-labels supersede. Maintained in [`github.com/lyse-labs/lyse-bench`](https://github.com/lyse-labs/lyse-bench) (CC BY 4.0).

Every Lyse PR runs `pnpm test:recall` in CI; the build blocks if any `stable` sub-axis's Wilson 95 % lower bound on **recall** drops below 0.90. Sub-axes ship `experimental` and promote to `stable` once calibrated past the gate.

### Pillar 3 — Coverage via the public catalogue

Lyse ships **6 axes** (`tokens`, `a11y`, `components`, `stories`, `ai-surface`, `ai-governance`) decomposed into **51 sub-axes** (1 per rule). Every sub-axis is tagged `stable`, `experimental`, or `disabled`. Only `stable` contributes to the Health Score by default. Promotion gate: N ≥ 30 samples AND Wilson 95 % LB ≥ 0.90 on recall — and, for **deterministic validators** (file-presence / JSON-schema / grammar rules whose verdict is structural, not context-dependent), on precision too. As of 2026-06-17, **28 sub-axes are `stable`** and contribute to the Health Score; the rest ship `experimental` (reported-only) and promote as calibration data accrues. The full catalogue is auto-generated at [`docs/architecture/sub-axes.md`](./sub-axes.md).

**score-v2 preview channel (#71).** `lyse explain --score` also reports a read-only **preview** score over a strict superset of the trusted set: the deterministic structural sub-axes whose synthetic recall *and* precision Wilson 95 % lower bounds both clear the 0.90 gate but which are not yet promoted into the live score (flagged `contributesToScoreV2`). The preview never alters the trusted Health Score — it exists so the impact of promoting the AI-governance moat can be inspected before any v1 change. Promoting a preview sub-axis into v1 (flipping `contributesToScore`) remains a deliberate release decision, not an automatic consequence of clearing the gate.

### Pillar 4 — Auto-improvement with a human gate

When the antivirus detects a regression, an Opus 4.7-driven pipeline runs nightly: failure detection clusters the misses, a diagnosis agent writes a ≤ 200-word explanation of why the rule missed (no code), a patch-proposal agent opens an isolated git worktree and asks Opus for a full-file replacement, then a validation agent re-runs `test:recall` and `pnpm test` inside the worktree. If the patch improves the target rule without regressing any other rule by more than 1 pp, the pipeline opens a **draft** PR. A human approves in ~30 seconds. The pipeline never auto-merges — that would break the deterministic + version-pinned public claim and the audit trail.

## The 3 falsifiable claims

Marketing surfaces use only these three claims; everything else is a derivative.

1. **100 % deterministic on the JSON artifact** — same input, same Health Score, byte-for-byte. Verifiable: run `lyse audit --format=json` twice on the same git commit; the JSON output is identical. Scoring formula is pinned as `scoring-v1` and stamped on the `AuditResult.scoringVersion` field of every emitted JSON artifact. Bumping to `scoring-v2` is a semver-major event with a CHANGELOG entry.
2. **≥ 90 % recall on every `stable` sub-axis** — measured against the public gold set, reported as a Wilson 95 % lower bound on N ≥ 30 hand-labelled samples. The per-rule SLO is published at [`docs/architecture/per-rule-slo.md`](./per-rule-slo.md). The table is seeded with the 17 rules; promotion to `stable` happens as the gold set grows.
3. **Open catalogue of 51 sub-axes (1 per rule)** — status published per axis at [`docs/architecture/sub-axes.md`](./sub-axes.md). 28 sub-axes are `stable`; the rest ship `experimental` and promote to `stable` as calibration data accrues.

## Reproducing the numbers

Everything above runs on your machine. The gold set lives at [`github.com/lyse-labs/lyse-bench`](https://github.com/lyse-labs/lyse-bench) (live, CC BY 4.0); clone it, point `lyse audit` at it, and compare your numbers to the published ones. If a number is wrong, send a PR.

## Gold-set composition

The gold set ships **provisional** at ~8k entries labelled by Claude
(Opus 4.7) via `scripts/auto-label-gold-v1.ts`. Each entry is tagged `provisional: true`
and `annotator: claude-opus-4-7-heuristic-v2`, with a `confidence` score in [0, 1]
reflecting heuristic strength.

This is intentional and disclosed: the gold-set seeds the precision/recall machinery before
community contributions take over. Methodology:

- Candidates mined from 9 pinned-SHA OSS design-system repos.
- Heuristic per rule (token-reference detection, file-context exclusion).
- Reproducible from `pinned-shas.json` + `auto-label-gold-v1.ts` at the matching git tag.

**Re-labelling.** The public `lyse-bench` repo (live, CC BY 4.0) accepts human-authored
corrections via PR. A community label supersedes the provisional Claude label of the
same `(repo, file, startLine)`. The Wilson-LB methodology in
[Pillar 2 — Recall via the antivirus harness](#pillar-2--recall-via-the-antivirus-harness)
remains unchanged — the bench composition is what evolves.

## Static-vs-LLM agreement (Cohen's kappa)

`packages/core/src/reliability/llm-eval/kappa.ts` computes, per governance
dimension, Cohen's kappa between the static rule verdict and the LLM grade,
plus precision/recall and their Wilson lower bounds (reusing
`wilsonLowerBound` from `promotion.ts`). A low kappa means a static rule has
drifted from the expert/LLM signal — the divergence signal Track 4.6 builds on.

The sub-axis calibration fields (`precisionMeasured`, `recallMeasured`,
`*WilsonLowerBound`, `lastCalibrated`) are **produced by running this
machinery over a labeled corpus** — they are never hand-committed. Until a
real per-dimension governance corpus exists, those fields stay `null`; the
machinery is exercised against in-repo fixtures only.

See also: [`docs/architecture/sub-axes.md`](./sub-axes.md), [`docs/architecture/per-rule-slo.md`](./per-rule-slo.md).

### Divergence signal (Track 4.6)

`packages/core/src/reliability/llm-eval/divergence.ts` implements the
self-policing mechanism: when a static rule's kappa falls **strictly below**
`DIVERGENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.4` (Landis & Koch 1977 "poor agreement" boundary),
`detectDivergence()` emits a `DivergenceDiagnostic`.

A `DivergenceDiagnostic` carries:

- `type: "rule-divergence"` — identifies it as a rule-health signal, not a DS-facing `Finding`
- `dimensionId` — the governance dimension that drifted
- `kappa` — the raw kappa value
- `disagreementRate` — `1 − observed agreement` (fraction of pairs where static ≠ LLM)

`buildKappaReport()` (schema `kappa/2.0`) runs `detectDivergence` over the
aggregated per-dimension results and attaches them under a `divergence` field.
Consumers can check `report.divergence` to find rules that have drifted from
the expert signal and should remain (or return to) `experimental` status.

The sub-axis calibration fields in `sub-axes.ts` stay `null` — the divergence
function operates on kappa inputs passed to it; it never commits measurement
values directly.
